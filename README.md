### Build dependencies

none right now, pure bash, should be essential everywhere

### Runtime dependencies

* curl
* scrot

### Repository Structure

We will keep this simple and a little bit overdimensioned

* master - main development
* debian/sid - as the name said, the branch for debian/sid
* upstream/latest - branch for latest releases (imported tar-balls)
* pristine-tar - branch for release tar-balls
